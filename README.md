## [Numpy and Pandas](Numpy_and_Pandas_.ipynb):-
### NumPy
stands for "Numerical Python". It is a library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
### Pandas
is a library that builds on top of NumPy and provides data structures and operations for working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data.
## [Matplotlib](Matplotlib.ipynb):-
Matplotlib is a Python library for data visualization. It provides a wide range of functionality for creating charts and plots, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and more.
